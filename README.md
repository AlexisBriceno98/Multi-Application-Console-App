# Alexis KyhProject1
Hey, This is my application called AP1 (Alexis Project 1) in this application we have 3 main programs that you might find useful.

In the main menu you can chose what you want to do:

You can calculate the area and perimeter of a Rectangle, Parallellogram, Triangle or Rhombus. 
You can calculate a mathematic problem with the help of 6 different arithmetic operations.
Lastly, for some fun, there's the option to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

All values are stored in a database called AlexisProject1, using C# Entity Framework

I've put a lot of time and effort into making this system error-free.
I used the Try, Catch, method in every while() as well as creating a generic error message that got personalized with colors for a more dynamic experience.

I am trying to achieve a clean menu for every application, thats why I am using several classes and calling in different methods.
Since there can be a lot of options I used a switch{} in every menu, this makes the code a lot cleaner.
